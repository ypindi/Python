////////////

What’s missing / should be explicit

Monotonic Stack (Next Greater Element, Daily Temps, Largest Rectangle, etc.)
You have “Stack”, but monotonic stack is a whole pattern by itself.

Prefix Sums + Hash Map (Subarray sum = K, 2D prefix sums)
Often lives under Arrays/Hashing but should be called out.

Union-Find (Disjoint Set Union)
(Number of Islands II, redundant connection, Kruskal MST)

Topological Sort (DAG ordering)
(Course Schedule, build systems)

Shortest Path patterns
BFS for unweighted, Dijkstra for weighted, sometimes Bellman-Ford.

Binary Search on Answer
(Koko Eating Bananas, capacity problems) — different from “plain” binary search.

Dynamic Programming subtypes

0/1 Knapsack, Unbounded knapsack

DP on subsequences (LIS), DP on strings

Tree DP

(Optional/advanced) Segment Tree / Fenwick (BIT) — shows up in harder sets.
